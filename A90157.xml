            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Oneals Eſcape out of the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THeſe times, I beleeve are not unacquainted with the ſiniſter diſpoſition of <hi>Oneal,</hi> who for his wicked intentions in the laſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the North was committed by the Houſe of Parliament to the Gate-Houſe, and afterwards hee was by the ſame power committed to the Tower, where he hath remained ever ſince. And upon the 4 of this preſent May, as one guilty of the Allegations againſt him, hee made his eſcape both from his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the preſent Iuſtice of the Law. The manner of his eſcape is after a very diverſe manner ſuppoſed, and judged; ſome ſuſpecting his Eſcape to be made in the diſguiſe of a Porters Frock, wherby hee did delude his Keepers apprehenſion; othets ſuſpecting his eſcape to be made over the walls, either by the help of a Roap, or elſe by ſome other inſtrument, which the Aſſiſtance of his preſent Fears or friends, did provide for him.</p>
            <p>This Priſoner being for ſome ſpace not ſeen as before in publique, a great Iealouſie immediately poſſeſſed the Keepers breaſt; whereupon fearing that he might be ſuddenly taken with ſome extream
<pb facs="tcp:156656:3"/> melady, which might occaſion his ſtay in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Lieutenant and other Officers immediatly went to his Chamber, ſuſpecting, and fearing him to be dead; but upon their ſearch, they found neither their priſoner, nor almoſt any thing in his Chamber, for between him and his boy, they had conveyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his bed one pair of ſheets, one Table-Cloath, and one long Towell, which did confirm their former feats of his Eſcape. And now finding to be true, what they before but ſuſpected, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant for his own ſecurity, gave preſent informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his eſcape unto the Parliament, who no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner received the News of his Eſcape, but wiſely conſidering the dangers that might enſue the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch an ill and diſaffected Member, gave pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Order for his apprehenſion, and gave Power and Commiſsion unto the ſaid Lieutenant of the Tower, to iſſue forth Warrants for his ſpeedy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions.</p>
            <p>The Allegations againſt him, which occaſioned his impriſonment, I have briefly and faithfully ſet down.</p>
